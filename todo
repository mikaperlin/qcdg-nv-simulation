investigate errors in U_int

add wrapper for U_int which accepts Vector3d target_axis
remove 'exact' from U_ctl and U_int: they should never be exact

test iSWAP on larmor pairs
fix up SWAP_NVST
- minimize use of U_int and U_ctl
- make it work for larmor pairs

candidate larmor pair seeds: 9746 10688 13481 15646 25272 40426 41142 47805 49308 52619 62086 91296 93794 93944 99582

itemize assumptions and approximations used in simulations

translate several pure states and density operators between abstract state and GA notations


add a mode to output operation protocol
 - use secondary script to remove operations which cancel out (e.g. two consecutive XX pulses)

remove "flushing"; correct for rotations in NV center rather than nuclei

if two SWAP_NVST targets are not larmor pairs,
  is it better to use natural bases, or a standard basis?

is it worthwhile to implement a zz coupling protocol?

implement state decay model
use non-ideal NV pulses?

compute corrections that need to be made to approximate gates, and perform them




investigate bad fidelities:
   target 9:
fac && time ./simulate --no_output --max_cluster_size 1 --hyperfine_cutoff 10 --c13_abundance 0.1 --seed 1 --static_Bz 2000 --iswap
   targets 3, 6, 9:
fac && time ./simulate --no_output --max_cluster_size 1 --hyperfine_cutoff 10 --c13_abundance 0.1 --seed 1 --static_Bz 2000 --control
