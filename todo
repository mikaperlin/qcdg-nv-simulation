implement individual addressing for larmor pairs
implement SWAP_NVST for larmor pairs
implement state decay model
use non-ideal NV pulses?
add a mode to output operation protocol
compute corrections that need to be made to approximate gates, and perform them

is it worthwhile to implement a zz coupling protocol?

if two SWAP_NVST targets are not larmor pairs,
  is it better to use natural bases, or a standard basis?

investigate bad fidelities (see target 9):
fac && time ./simulate --no_output --max_cluster_size 1 --hyperfine_cutoff 10 --c13_abundance 0.1 --seed 1 --iswap
