add protocol to perform SWAP_NVST with two spins which are not larmor pairs

try all simulations with different scale factors


determine likeliness of performing SWAP_NVST with high fidelity, as a function of:
- hyperfine_cutoff
- dw_min
- c13_abundance
- collect metadata on these cases (e.g. the magnitude of hyperfine_perp, operation time, etc.)
- consider nonzero dw_12 (difference between larmor frequencies of target nuclei)?


itemize assumptions and approximations used in simulations

cluster nuclei whose effective larmor frequencies are within cluster_factor


translate several pure states and density operators between abstract state and GA notations


add a mode to output operation protocol
 - use secondary script to remove operations which cancel out (e.g. two consecutive XX pulses)

if two SWAP_NVST targets are not larmor pairs,
  is it better to use natural bases, or a standard basis?

is it worthwhile to implement a zz coupling protocol?

implement state decay model, non-ideal NV pulses

compute corrections that need to be made to approximate gates, and perform them
