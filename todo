ignore action of operators on the environment when computing gate fidelities

fix spin drift of larmor pairs after interaction with NV center

finish implementing individual addressing

remove 'exact' from U_ctl and U_int

implement SWAP_NVST for larmor pairs

candidate larmor pair seeds: 9746 10688 13481 15646 25272 40426 41142 47805 49308 52619 62086 91296 93794 93944 99582

itemize assumptions and approximations used in simulations

translate several pure states and density operators between abstract state and GA notations


add a mode to output operation protocol
 - use secondary script to remove operations which cancel out (e.g. two consecutive XX pulses)

remove "flushing"; correct for rotations in NV center rather than nuclei

if two SWAP_NVST targets are not larmor pairs,
  is it better to use natural bases, or a standard basis?

is it worthwhile to implement a zz coupling protocol?

implement state decay model
use non-ideal NV pulses?

compute corrections that need to be made to approximate gates, and perform them




investigate bad fidelities:
   target 9:
fac && time ./simulate --no_output --max_cluster_size 1 --hyperfine_cutoff 10 --c13_abundance 0.1 --seed 1 --static_Bz 2000 --iswap
   targets 3, 6, 9:
fac && time ./simulate --no_output --max_cluster_size 1 --hyperfine_cutoff 10 --c13_abundance 0.1 --seed 1 --static_Bz 2000 --control
