typical fluctuations in magnetic field
comparison between larmor pair memory and individual nuclear spins
implement T1 decay considerations; how does performance change with temperature
memory storage fidelity
best/typical case fidelity









itemize assumptions and approximations used in simulations

cluster nuclei whose effective larmor frequencies are within cluster_factor


add a mode to output operation protocol
 - use secondary script to remove operations which cancel out (e.g. two consecutive X pulses)

if two SWAP_NVST targets are not larmor pairs,
  is it better to use natural bases, or a standard basis?

non-ideal NV pulses

compute and perform corrections that need to be made to approximate gates
