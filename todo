memory storage fidelity:
  (i) decoupled NV center
  (ii) no NV center (i.e. NV center in |0> state)

best/typical fidelity

implement T1 decay considerations; how does performance change with temperature?
comparison between memory of larmor pairs, and that of individual nuclear spins
consider typical fluctuations in magnetic field









itemize assumptions and approximations used in simulations

cluster nuclei whose effective larmor frequencies are within cluster_factor


add a mode to output operation protocol
 - use secondary script to remove operations which cancel out (e.g. two consecutive X pulses)

if two SWAP_NVST targets are not larmor pairs,
  is it better to use natural bases, or a standard basis?

non-ideal NV pulses

compute and perform corrections that need to be made to approximate gates
