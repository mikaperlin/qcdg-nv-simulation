likeliness of larmor pair as a function of C-13 abundance
- coupling < 40/100 Hz to other nuclear spins
- find typical value of hyperfine vector

simulations to find directions of nuclei
perform elementary gate


identify larmor pair
measuring nuclear spin location
fidelity of individual controlling
fidelity storing information


consider decoupling field (at some point)



memory storage fidelity:
  (i) decoupled NV center
  (ii) no NV center (i.e. NV center in |0> state)

best/typical fidelity

implement T1 decay considerations; how does performance change with temperature?
comparison between memory of larmor pairs, and that of individual nuclear spins
consider typical fluctuations in magnetic field









itemize assumptions and approximations used in simulations

cluster nuclei whose effective larmor frequencies are within cluster_factor


add a mode to output operation protocol
 - use secondary script to remove operations which cancel out (e.g. two consecutive X pulses)

if two SWAP_NVST targets are not larmor pairs,
  is it better to use natural bases, or a standard basis?

non-ideal NV pulses

compute and perform corrections that need to be made to approximate gates
